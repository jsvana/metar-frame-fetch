# metar_fetch

Rust CLI to fetch METAR data, determine flight categories, and upload them to a [custom Arduino sectional frame](https://github.com/jsvana/metar-frame).

**Important note: this is not useful unless you have the exact same circuit and Arduino sketch as I'm using, so just use it as a reference.**
